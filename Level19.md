First i tried to see if maybe bandit17 had read prmissions to the readme file but that did not work
Next I tried to see if maybe connecting via telnet would work but it did not.



After thinking a bit i had an idea. maybe if i scp the file to my local machine it could work.This worked using the articlehttps://www.freecodecamp.org/news/scp-linux-command-example-how-to-ssh-file-transfer-from-remote-to-local/ 
for knowing about scp syntax.
